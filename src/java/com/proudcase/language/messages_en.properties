# aboutus.xhtml
aboutus_title=About us
aboutproudcase_head=About Proudcase
aboutproudcase_desc=Proudcase is a startup which is currently in the beta phase. The objective of Proudcase is to provide a platform where human and their skills will increase their popularity as well as enthusiasm, empathy, and affection. Faithful to the motto "Everyone can do something" has every person here the chance to demonstrate their practical skills and to change their whole life. In this case, we attach great importance to fairness, solidarity, and discretion. On the first position is the user which is the Centre of the business. All profits (if this business would generate profits) are hidden in the background.
aboutceoandcreator_head=CEO & Founder
aboutceoandcreator_desc=My name is Michel Vocks, I'm 23 years old and I live in Germany. I study Software Engineering at the Fontys University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands (Venlo). A few months ago, I spend one semester at the Hanyang University which is located in Seoul (South Korea). I discovered my passion for developing applications when I was nine years old. At a time where DOS and Windows 95 was the standard on the market, I developed my own little video games and did some practice on improving my hacking skills. Later, with twelve years, I developed my own personal "Space invaders"-clone and did my first steps in the section "development of web applications". Additionally, I spend a lot of time to discover the operating system "Gentoo Linux" which is for me the Linux distribution of the Linux distributions.

page_information=<h2><i>"Everyone can do something"</i></h2><p style="margin-bottom:40px;text-align: justify;">Every individual person on the world has at least one talent, most people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that they have a talent or they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how valuable this talent is. Mostly, talents are never discovered or the people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough courage to share their talent with the public. I want to tackle this particular problem here on this platform! </p><h2><i>How does it work?</i></h2><p style="margin-bottom:40px;text-align: justify;">Every registered user has the possibility to create a so-called "Showcase". A Showcase includes at least one subject and a text which describe the talent of the user. Additionally, it is possible to add pictures and videos to describe the talent more in detail. After populating the Showcase for our jury, all jury members are invited to give a feedback and to rate this talent. In case that the Showcase should gain at least three positive feedbacks and ratings, the status of the showcase will be set to \u00e2\u0080\u009capproved\u00e2\u0080\u009d and is subsequently available for the worldwide community. Furthermore, every user has the possibility to rate other showcases to increase their popularity. </p><h2><i>What is my motivation?</i></h2><p style="margin-bottom:40px;text-align: justify;">In case that your talent got three positive feedbacks from three different jury members, you get the chance to obtain the "Proudcase-Star" with your Showcase. With the "Proudcase-Star" you will be added to the hall of fame which greatly increases your chance to get discovered. Furthermore, your Showcase will be added for one week to the front-page of the proudcase-platform which will definitely increase your popularity. </p><h2><i>Who is the jury?</i></h2><p style="margin-bottom:40px;text-align: justify;">Currently we have handful jury members which were selected by myself. In the following weeks the proudcase-platform will gain a new functionality that allows normal users to vote for a favorite user to join the jury group. The users with the most votes will become a jury member as long as the user agrees the vote. Additionally, a new functionality will be added to the proudcase-platform which gives the users the opportunity to deselect a jury member after a certain time. In case that you are now interested in to become a jury member you, you can always send your detailed application to the following E-Mail address: <b>application@proudcase.com</b></p>
