# aboutus.xhtml
aboutus_title=About us
aboutproudcase_head=About Proudcase
aboutproudcase_desc Proudcase is a young startup which is currently in the first release phase. \
The objective of Proudcase is to provide a platform where human and their skills will increase their popularity. \
Faithful to the motto "Everyone can do something" has every person here the chance to demonstrate their practical skills and to change their whole life. \
In this case, we attach great importance to fairness, solidarity, and discretion. On the first position is the user which is the centre of the business. \
All profits (if this business would generate profits) are hidden in the background.
aboutceoandcreator_head=CEO & Founder
aboutceoandcreator_desc=My name is Michel Vocks, I'm 23 years old and I live in Germany. \
I study Software Engineering at the Fontys University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands (Venlo). \
A few months ago, I spend one semester at the Hanyang University which is located in Seoul (South Korea). \
I discovered my passion for developing applications when I was nine years old. At a time where DOS and Windows 95 was the standard on the market, \
I developed my own little video games and did some practice on improving my hacking skills. \
Later, with twelve years, I developed my own personal "Space invaders"-clone and did my first steps into the section "development of web applications". \
Additionally, I spend a lot of time to discover the operating system "Gentoo Linux" which is for me the Linux distribution of the Linux distributions.

# pageinfo.xhtml

pageinfo_indextext=Here you get the chance to distribute to a worldwide community what you are proud of, what you makes enthusiastic and what defines you! <a href="/pageinfo.xhtml">Click here to get more information...</a>
page_information <h2><i>How does it work?</i></h2> \
<p style="margin-bottom:40px;text-align: justify;">Every registered user has the possibility to create one or more so-called \u201dShowcase\u201d. \
A Showcase includes at least one subject and a text which describes the project/talent of the user. Additionally, it is possible to add pictures, videos \
and files to describe the project/talent more in detail. After that, the showcase can be made public to open it for reviews and ratings from the worldwide \
community. Other community members can contact the owner of the showcase and can follow the owner for new updates.</p> \
<h2><i>What is my motivation?</i></h2> \
<p style="margin-bottom:40px;text-align: justify;">Proudcase makes it easy, fast and comfortable for your to upload your projects online and that \
completely free! Many projects can't survive because of the fact that they can't get in contact with the user group or they have not the financial background \
to generate exclusive advertisement. This problem will be solved with proudcase because it includes a worldwide community.</p> \
<h2><i>What possibilities do I have with a Showcase?</i></h2> \
<p style="margin-bottom:40px;text-align: justify;">A Showcase is an egg-laying, milk-bearing woolly sow. Which actually means that there are no restrictions \
for a Showcase. You can add pictures, videos and files to a showcase. The description part of a Showcase supports completely HTML which allows the user to fully \
optimize it. Additionally, the description part can be directly translated into several languages to be more open with your Showcase. A Showcase can be used for \
a wide range, without any limitations. You can share your Showcase with your friends, your family or directly with the whole world! You want to apply for a job \
in the future? Just upload all your experienced projects and add text, pictures and videos to it. Then you can easily add a link (or your nickname) to your \
application to show the company what kind of great experience you have! These and many many many other useful scenarios are possible with proudcase.</p> \
<h2><i>Why proudcase?</i></h2>\
<p style="margin-bottom:40px;text-align: justify;">Every individual person on the world has at least one talent, most people do not \
know that they have a talent or they do not know how valuable this talent is. Mostly, talents are never discovered or the \
people do not have enough courage to share their talent with the public. I want to tackle this particular problem here on \
this platform! </p>
